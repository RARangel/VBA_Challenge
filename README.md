# Module 2: VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis was to use VBA code to write macros to report on stocks prices for
various tickers in 2017 and 2018. 

### Results: 
The best performing stock in 2017 was DQ, which yielded 199.4% returns.
The best performing stock in 2018 was RUN, which yielded 81.9% returns.

The worst performing stock in 2017 was TERP, which yielded -7.2% losses.
The worst performing stock in 2018 was DQ, which yielded -62.6% losses.

The code ran 0.65 seconds for 2017.
The code ran 0.64 seconds for 2018.

I did not have great success refracting the code to obtain better exection times. 
I had a hard time with the column for tickerVolumes --I really wasn't sure what the exercise was asking.

### Summary: 
The advantages of refactoring code  is to create faster run time of macros.
The disadvantages of refactoring code  is time spent actually trying to figure it out. :)

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pros are designing code to be more efficient and prodcutive.
