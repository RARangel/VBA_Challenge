# election-analysis
Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis was to use VBA code to write macros to report on stocks prices for
various tickers in 2017 and 2018. 

Results: 
The best performing stock in 2017 was DQ, which yielded 199.4% returns.
The best performing stock in 2018 was RUN, which yielded 81.9% returns.

The worst performing stock in 2017 was TERP, which yielded -7.2% losses.
The worst performing stock in 2018 was DQ, which yielded -62.6% losses.

The code ran 0.65 seconds for 2017.
The code ran 0.64 seconds for 2018.

I did not have success refracting the code to obtain better exection times. 


Summary: 
The advantages of refactoring code  is to create faster run time of macros.
The disadvantages of refactoring code  is time spent actually trying to figure it out. 

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
